 Custom adaptation of classic "Snake" game. I completed this project for my high school Intro to Python class in fall 2021. This was my first project 
 implementing a GUI and my first time using the PyGame library. The starter code was adapted from Al Sweigart.
 
 The first two levels are similar to the original Snake game, with the second level having the worm move at a faster speed than the first. I customized the
 appearance of each level and programmed the worm's movement and behavior when it reaches an apple.

 For the third level, I was tasked with putting my own spin on levels 1 and 2. I chose to create a CPU worm which turns in the opposite direction of the
 user's worm and creates an additional obstacle. I also made two apple types of my own: one with a higher point value, one granting bonus lives. Finally, I
 made my own landing page, instructions, and leaderboard.

 This project was assigned before I  learned about object-oriented programming. However, if I were to re-make this project today, I would have used 
 principles of inheritance to make parent classes for the worms and apples to avoid repetition of code and, for the apples, to control how they appear and
 disappear from polymorphic methods.
